A makefile provides some useful commands:

    make build to compile. This creates an ftest.native executable
    make demo to run the ftest program with some arguments
    make format to indent the entire project
    make edit to open the project in VSCode
    make clean to remove build artifacts

In case of trouble with the VSCode extension (e.g. the project does not build, there are strange mistakes), a common workaround is to (1) close vscode, (2) make clean, (3) make build and (4) reopen vscode (make edit).
